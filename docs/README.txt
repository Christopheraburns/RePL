Why Python?

I don't like dynamically typed languages - hard to grow a large code base, hard to debug (visually)

However, the good stuff about Python outweighs the bad stuff. 

Language	Robotics	NLP	Computer Vision	Raspberry PI	Data Mining	GUI	Backend Code	AWS SDK
--------	--------	---	---------------	------------	-----------	---	------------	-------
Python		yes		yes	yes		yes		yes		yes	yes		yes


In addition to the above libraries and modules there is wealth of literature, tutorials and sample code written in python that 
will help deplete the project's technical debt.
